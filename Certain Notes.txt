Certain Notes:

A: Two ways to create a method

1. You can add a method (essentially a function) under the main public class:
which is public class App.
	
	For example:

	public static void Product(){
	
	System.out.println("bruh")

	}
	
Which you can then class simply as Product() where you need it called.

2. You can add a method under App_Methods.java file. Just the same way of creating a method under public class main. However, this is better and more correct in case we need to make objects.

To call, you now need to put in App_Methods.Product() where you need it called.
